## Dataset
We only provide the public part [[link]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e2t5HhQf08sTAE_CPRNVgpi6YUKgQSHn?usp=sharing) with its bbox we labeled [[link]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K06-VFm6b64Rhu-ehBtJ4OY6Yk7YZyIm/view?usp=sharing) of the CPC-paired Dataset while the another part is private. Thanks for understanding. And you should label the bounding box of the polyp and crop for preprocessing.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download Pretrained Weights
We provide the pretrained weights of the model which were mentioned in the paper.
* Base Weights (vit_small_patch16_224_in21k) [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I10_qXlUEtSjlvRWQjoBnKnVSLUYjF8C/view?usp=sharing)

For other model sizes, please refer to this table and download on the Internet or contact us to provide.

* Smaller Weights (vit_tiny_patch16_224_in21k)
* Larger Weights (vit_base_patch16_224_in21k)


## Run
we set the argument "fold" (default: 0) for k-fold cross validation, you can omit it if unnecessary.
```bash
python main.py --data_path /the/data/path/ --weights /the/pretrained/weights/path/
```
